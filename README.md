## Flowers-classifier using TensorFlow and Keras

###   **TensorFlow** is one of the most used ML libraries used today and the **Keras** API is really an add on to the already powerful tool. 
Often multiclass classification is harder than *binary classification*.

#### Only accuracy isn't important while developing a Machine Learning model.
Apart from the accuracy, its very important as to how the model performs on new unseen images from the real world. Google Colab is 
really an efficient tool that helps to train out models faster by providing **GPU** support.
